# Chicken Tinder

The idea is simple; you pair with friends, swipe on nearby places to eat, and when you match we'll let you know!

## How to play

**Step 1**: You must create and account or login. This PWA is a part of the SSO Portfolio by Kevin Haube.

**Step 2**: Once logged in, you will need to add friends and then invite them to the group.

**Step 3**: Once one or more people have joined the group, you can begin swiping. Users will be able to set their user preference settings both before joining the group and during swiping.

**Step 4**: You matched! The restaurant that you've matched on will be presented to both players with the address clickable to launch via Apple Maps and Google Maps.
